# Datascience
This repository contains  two data structures tuples and stacks.

##  Tuples
It is an immutable data structure; you  can assign a value that cannot be  changed. Tuples are ordered, they are indexed, and also immutable. It is
used as a parenthesis checker and it is used to insert records  in a database.

## Stacks
A stack is a linear data structure that holds a linear, ordered sequence of elements. Stacks works in a last-in-first-out or LIFO manner,
All insertions can occur only at the top of the stack. Stacks  are used for backtracking ie checking to match in an expression. Stacks are used to convert 
one form of expression to another.

#Queues
A queue is a collection that consists of a collection of items that follow the first-in-fist-out rule. This implies the first item to be inserted is the first item to be removed
